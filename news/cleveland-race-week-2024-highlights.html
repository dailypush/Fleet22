        <p>And that’s a wrap. The 43rd annual Cleveland Race Week concluded with two weekends and six exhilarating days
            of sailing on Lake Erie, right in front of the Edgewater Yacht Club.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8">
                <p>The first weekend presented light and challenging conditions. Despite this, the talented and
                    experienced race committee managed to conduct three races on Saturday and two on Sunday before the
                    winds died down. The podium finishers for the first weekend were: 3rd place – Unbridled (Robert
                    Mock), 2nd place – Kashmir (Hickman & Kjoller), and 1st place – Arbitrade (Bruce Stone & Nicole
                    Breault). Teams from St. Francis Yacht Club and North Cape Yacht Club in Michigan claimed the top
                    two spots for the first weekend.</p>
                <p>The second weekend saw the local teams regroup and shine over four days of racing. Trio (Uhlir
                    Brothers and Tim Roberts) secured 3rd place, Unbridled (Robert Mock) moved up to 2nd place, and
                    Arbitrade (Bruce Stone & Nicole Breault) maintained their dominance, finishing in 1st place once
                    again.</p>
                <p>Tuesday featured races for the women's and double-handed fleets. J 105 Class President Nicole Breault
                    found a ride and contributed to Team Kashmir’s efforts. Notably, Laura Schaefer delivered an
                    impressive performance, securing 3rd place in the women's sailing category. Her skill and
                    determination were evident as she navigated the challenging conditions, making her a standout in the
                    fleet.</p>
                <p>The final day of racing brought 20-25 knots of breeze and 4–6 foot waves, creating conditions
                    reminiscent of San Francisco's waters. This delightful challenge provided a fitting send-off for the
                    winning team, ensuring they didn't miss their home waters too much.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-4">Testimonials from Participants</h2>
